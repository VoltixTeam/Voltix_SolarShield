# KiCad Parts library for Voltix Hardware

This repository contains schematic symbols and footprints for the parts on the Voltix board, Voltix probe and the Voltix shields.

Since quite some of the parts are shared betwen the designs, we keep them in this central repository which is integrated as submodule in the other repositories.
